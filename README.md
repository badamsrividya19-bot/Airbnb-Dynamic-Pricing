# Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a dynamic pricing recommendation system for Airbnb listings using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
Pricing plays a crucial role in the success of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb. Setting prices too high can reduce bookings, while low prices may lead to revenue loss. This project aims to recommend optimal prices for Airbnb listings by analyzing listing attributes and customer engagement data.

## Objectives
- Analyze Airbnb listing characteristics
- Predict listing prices using machine learning
- Recommend competitive prices for hosts
- Support data-driven pricing decisions

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains Airbnb listing-level information, including:
- Location
- Room type
- Availability
- Number of reviews
- Base listing price

Categorical attributes are encoded, and numerical features are used to train a regression model.

## Methodology
1. Data preparation and preprocessing  
2. Encoding categorical variables (location, room type)  
3. Feature scaling  
4. Training a regression-based machine learning model  
5. Predicting listing prices  
6. Applying pricing logic to generate recommended prices  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
The project generates a CSV file containing:
- Predicted price for each listing
- Recommended price based on pricing strategy

## Files in this Repository
- `airbnb_dynamic_pricing.ipynb` – Implementation notebook
- `Airbnb_Pricing_Output.csv` – Output file with predicted and recommended prices

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to dynamic pricing problems in the hospitality domain. The pricing recommendations generated by the model can help Airbnb hosts optimize revenue while staying competitive in the market.
